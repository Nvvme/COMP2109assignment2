# COMP2109assignment2
My 2nd assignment for my Content Mgmt-E-Comm Platforms, COMP2109 class :))
Hi Professor Mcculley,

I wanted to apologize for the state of this assignment submission. I had to rush because something came up and as a result, the functionality isn’t fully there. I understand this isn’t ideal, and I’m disappointed I couldn’t showcase my best work.

I appreciate any marks you can provide (if any) and look forward to using this as a learning experience to deliver an excellent final project.

Thanks for your understanding.
